### HiðŸ‘‹, I'm Le Phu Truong.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently studying Data Science at the University of Science, VNU-HCM.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: lephutruong.2210@gmail.com.
- ðŸ”­ I have created a repository that I am very passionate about Machine Learning theory. If you want to refer, please contact me via the email address above, below is the main content of the $\text{Machine-Learning}$ repository:

## 1. Introduction to Machine Learning

An overview of Machine Learning along with practicing Python coding to store files and images. In addition, we will practice a project on predicting house prices to better understand ML and will code a bit about matrix derivatives using Numerical Analysis.

+ The Machine Learning landscape.
+ Numerical_in_Matrix_Derivatives.
+ End-to-end Machine Learning project.

## 2. Linear Regression and Overfitting
