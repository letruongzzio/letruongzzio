- ðŸ“« How to reach me: lephutruong.2210@gmail.com.
- ðŸ”­ I have created a repository that I am very passionate about Machine Learning theory. If you want to refer, please contact me via the email address above, below is the main content of the $\text{Machine-Learning}$ repository:

    **1. Introduction to Machine Learning**
    
    An overview of Machine Learning along with practicing Python coding to store files and images. In addition, we will practice a project on predicting house prices to better understand ML and will code a bit about matrix derivatives using Numerical Analysis.
    
    + The Machine Learning landscape.
    + Numerical in Matrix Derivatives.
    + End-to-end Machine Learning project.
    
    **2. Linear Regression and Overfitting**
